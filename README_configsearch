Ansible scripts for Config Search

This script involves SSH logins to remote F5s and has been tested from RHEL unit.
To authenticate using Shared Keys, copy over local ssh public key from /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to remote F5 at .ssh/authorized_keys
(If the local machine does not have ssh keys generated, generate them by using command "ssh-keygen -t rsa")

Make sure to modify "hosts" file under "inventory" to specify BigIPs included in the script.
Default inventory file should be at /etc/ansible/hosts (path is by default specified under /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file)
